_Mr. Ardha passed away at July 25, 2023. An Islamic funeral was held the next day, at July 26, 2023._

He was a mentor and good friend to me. He is the one who motivates me to learn JavaScript and web development. I lost count on how many times I asked him to teach me about web development or programming in general.

_Farewell, devardha._
