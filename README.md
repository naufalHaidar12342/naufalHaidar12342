**1. Q: What kind of language used in this repo?**

- A: Mainly in *Indonesian* ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© , althought i could refactor it to *American English* ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.

- P.S : *English* is my second language, so don't expect the best out of me.



**Q: How many programming language you are fluent in?**

A: Currently, not many. I'm still learning about Python, Java, PHP, and JS (HTML and CSS too, for those who consider these 2 languages aren't part of programming).



**Q: What is your first programming language?**

A: Well, Pyhton is my first language. I'm amazed on how Python could perform the same task but with less steps and the *English* terms being used as it's function are easier to comprehend, compared to Java. (on a small scale program, like giving output of arithmatic operation , for example)
